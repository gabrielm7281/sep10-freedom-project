# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **X**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in Aviation

For my project, I chose the topic of **Aviation**. I decided to pick this topic because I am really intrested in planes and already knew a lot about them, so it was an easy way to start off. For the project, we were supposed to show off current and previous technologies that were signifigant in the field. For example, I chose to show Fly-By-Wire systems and radars that the pilots use. The next part of the product was to design a product that solved a problem that the field was having. I chose to make a new plane that was made to get small remote communities to the outside world, which is explained further below.

To create the website, I used HTML, CSS, and Github. I also chose to independently study **[Foundation](getfoundation.com)** in order to help and add on to the design of the site.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Can take off from nearly anywhere in the world because of its tough build
* Takes high amounts of cargo for its size so that people can carry more to support their community
* Very cheap to build and maintain so its affordable to millions around the world
##### CONS
* You have to attach parts to it yourself (Wings to fuselage, wheels to their bays) or pay to have it fully assembled
* Heavy cargo may affect its performance and range
* If there are major problems it can be quite hard to fix it without proper support and parts


## Blog
Below you will find the blogs about how I made my project. It goes over all of the progress that I made, from the beginning of the year to the end of the project. It highlights how I grew as a coder and shows some major problems I had with the project and how I overcame them. It mainly focuses on the HTML side of things, but expands to how I learned and dealt with Foundation in the later entries

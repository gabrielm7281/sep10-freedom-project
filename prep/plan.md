| Derek | I like how there is a part b of the website | You should make the buttons on the navbar send you to the section. |
| Abdelrahman  | I like the use of cards, looks very sick | Agree with previous person. The navbar title says 'Site title', and the buttons don't work. Or at least not as they should.

      <h3>My Idea and its Purpose</h3>
      <p>My idea for the Freedom Project was actually kinda difficult to come up with. It had to be something new and innovative but there is a lot that pilots already have. I didnt really know what to come up with since aviation is very matured and is constantly improving upon previous tools and components. I decided to go with a new plane since that was the easiest to come up with. For the new design, I wanted a cheap plane that could handle a lot of different things and have a focus on
      customizability to allow it to be as versatile and useful as possible.<br>

      <br>
      There are several companies who offer up the parts to a plane and allow you to assemble the parts together. This is good to keep costs low, and gives the pilot the ability to properly understand their airplane. They are usually very light and they can't carry a lot. However I want to go against that and create something that would be useful to quite a lot of people. Often people in remote areas have to drive for hours to reach civlization, and if they do have cargo it will only be very little in most cases. This will change lives across the world and supply thousands of people with access to better oppurtunities </p>

          <h4>How its Innovative (WIP)</h4>
          <p>This is a new innovative design because of what is currently availible to people. A lot of planes require a bunch of liscences to fly which are expensive to get so that is obviously a major reason why a lot of people cant use them. The planes that are more availible however, are all very expensive and difficult to operate and maintain. This design goes around that by cutting costs in manufacturing by sending parts of the plane for you to assemble instead of them building and delivering it to you (Option to have it assembled at the plant for more money). This encourages people to make sure that the plane is perfect and increases safety. The engine is also innovative because it is a hybrid, which allows for instant power to the engine and can operate a lot more electric systems than a standard engine. It would also use a modified version of a car engine since they are simalair sizes in some cases.</p>

            <h3>Context</h3>
                <p class="c1">The history of aviation goes back to the early 1900s, where the Wright brothers built a flying machine out of fabrics, some basic supports and a small engine. The industry has obviously come a long way since then. It went from a small project to carrying millions of people a year, and becoming an important part of life across the world because of its versatilty. There is tons of cool new technology that has been created specifically for it, and even more that is still brand new which is what I will be showing off in this part of the Freedom Project</p>

                    <p>A lot of planes without a lot of flight systems like weather radars or extensive GPS systems rely on mobile apps such as Veyron for those extra functions. A lot of independent pilots will have a tablet with them that keeps track of their systems, lets them look at radar data across the world and provides lists of Pre-Flight checks. There are many more apps and extras that pilots may use</p>

                      <p>The mechanics of a plane can get very complicated but there are 3 main parts to it. The lift a plane gets is how it floats in the air and it is created by its wings, with low pressure air on the top and high pressure air flowing down the bottom of the wing. The engine of a plane pulls the plane forwards. The propeller creates thrust from its rotation and that is what allows the plane to move and "cut" through the air. It's control surfaces allow the plane to be manuevered through the air by pushing air in the direction you ask it to go in.</p>

### What Have I Done So Far?
Since the last blog, a decent amount has happened. Me and Luca decided to be partners since we are both doing our projects on aviation and planes. This was very important especially if we both keep up with everything because things can be a lot easier since the workload will be split up. We have also started brainstorming and finalizing what our idea is for the Freedom Project. This process doesnt need much and is only really taking your ideas from before and turning it into a proper list and description. You also have to create a introduction for everyone who might see your website.

We have also started brainstorming and finalizing what our idea is for the Freedom Project. This process doesnt need much and is only really taking your ideas from before and turning it into a proper list and description. You also have to create a introduction for everyone who might see your website.

I also noticed that a lot of people understand and like to mod their cars, or at least have basic mechanical knowledge to diagnose engine problems, so I decided to create a much simpler

### What Have I Done So Far?

  Since the last blog, a decent amount has happened. Me and Luca decided to be partners since we are both doing our projects on **aviation/planes.** This was very important especially if we both keep up with everything because things can be a lot easier since the workload will be split up. We have also started brainstorming and finalizing what our idea is for the Freedom Project. This process doesnt need much and is only really taking your ideas from before and turning it into a proper list and description. You also have to create a introduction for everyone who might see your website.

  For my idea, I noticed how a lot of planes require a lot of training and are very expensive for what they give you, even if you only get the liscences. I decided to create a Kit Plane(A plane you put together yourself), which has exsisted for a while but was also always very complex. I also noticed that a lot of people understand and like to mod their cars, or at least have basic mechanical knowledge to diagnose engine problems, so I decided to create a much simpler Kit Plane with premade parts that you only have to attach to a very solid frame, or an option to have it built on site in a factory for slightly more. I also want this to be like a heavy duty pickup truck for carrying around more cargo.

  Finalizing this idea is problably the most important thing that I have to do. To do this, we take our ideas and our notes about the past inventions and put them together into one cohesive document that can easily be turned into a website. I am going to seperate the two categories into Part A and B, which will be called **The Past** and **The Future** (Could possibly change later on). For Part A, or **The Past**, we have to make an introduction to our topic and the idea which should be in simple terms so that anybody can understand it, even if its very complex. This will all eventually come together after the break when we start using the CSS we learned to make a nice looking website to share.

### Huge Sources
A lot of big sources that I got my reasearch from is [Garmin](Garmin.com). Their websites and product pages were a huge help especially with cockpit devices and hardware such as autopilot systems and weather displays. A lot of other bits and pieces came from various different sites and trusted/popular aviation blogs and articles such as [Simple Flying](https://simpleflying.com/). I also had some softwares from military development companies, but in general I had to make sure that the information I was getting and paraphrasing was correct.

### Skills I Learned

I feel like I didnt do as much for this section of the Freedom Project as some others, and the time between Blog 2 and Blog 3 was also less than between Blog 1 and 2. Howevery, I did learn that it is very importnat to communicate what is happening.

Since Luca has been out this entire week, we didnt get much done together. I think he has done his part of the assignments but I am not sure. This highlights the importance of communication because without it, we are going to be stuck until after the break. Since Part B does need both partners to work together, I think that I should push for better communicaiton on Slack between us if we are both availible during the week.

### Engineering Design Process
We are entering Stage 4 of the EDP. We have already made our project ideas and have finalized them. This means we only have to plan how to get the product to be at a reasonable level.

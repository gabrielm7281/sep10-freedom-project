# Entry 1: The Project

### What Am I Doing For the Freedom Project?
--- 
  For the SEP10 Freedom Project, I chose the topic of **Aviation (Behind the Scenes).** I want to be a pilot for a career later on. I always loved looking and being on planes and pilots have even let me sit in their chair a few times. This and the fact that I have several family members involved in something to do with Aerospace, I have been very exposed to Aviation. Since a lot of people dont have this kind of oppurtunity, or have never even flown before, **I want to show them what happens during a flight compared to what you normally see. This could also help with peoples fear of flying,** since they have no idea what actually happens while they are in the air. 

  Ways that I can plan to do this are showing videos or explaining what happens inside of the cockpit and in the back using terms that everyone should be able to understand, since planes can get kind of technical. Another way that I plan on trying to explain this to people is including a program on plane tvs that has a cockpit cam so they can see exactly what happens while they are flying. Large plane manufacturers such as [Boeing](Boeing.com) and [Airbus](Airbus.com) can problably give good information about what happens in the cockpit. [Garmin](Garmin.com) is also a great place to get information about some of the technology that pilots use since they are the main manufactuer for a lot of autopilot and screens you see in a picture.

### Skills I Will Problably Learn

- Patience
- Better Reasearching
<br>

Patience will most likely be something I might have to improve on, especially for certain information that is difficult to find online. A lot of times I just quit and go back later, usually when the due date is a lot closer. I should try things so that I dont quit on what I am trying to do and find ways to get around my issues. This also ties into learning how to properly look up things so that I dont have these problems to begin with. I often put in a semi vauge search and hope that I find what I am looking for on the first page. If not, then I reword it which is not a very good system especially if I am looking for something specific. This will definitley help speed up that process and things a lot easier for me.

I am on stage 2 of the EDP. I have already found what I want to solve so I just need to work on reasearching how to do it.

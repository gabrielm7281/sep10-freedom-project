### What Have I Done So Far?

There hasnt been a lot of progress on the actual Freedom Project, but we have been working on learning new ways to create a website to display the final model of the project. We are using something called a Framework, which is kind of a library that stores complicated code, and lets its users display the code with a lot less effort and time (Takes a large amount of code and squishes it into just one line). They also make a grid onto your screen, allowing you to assign different elements to different places on your screen. For example you can have a paragraph taking up 3 out of 12 grid slots on a screen. Breakpoints are just sizes that the system recognizes as different from others. This lets you adjust certain elements to fit the different screen sizes. For example you can have that same paragraph taking up 6 of 12 grid slots on a widescreen TV vs the 3 out of 12 on a phone.

The names of the Frameworks that I am using are Bootstrap and Foundation. Bootstrap is a much larger and more generalized Framework and has a much larger variety of code. It allows its users to easily import tons of code that creates a responsive and clean website, with the use of breakpoints and grids. Since you have so much flexibility with just the grid alone, it makes things so much easier than CSS. The second Framework, Foundation, is more focused on menus and buttons. It has the same grid and breakpoint system as Bootstrap but its other components are not the same. You can use the two in one page to elevate it further. Foundation has a lot more utility when you are making a site with tons of different pages and buttons for you to click around on. It has multiple options for buttons, dropdowns, and menu bars to navigate around. It also has uses for looking at comments or displaying different choices to make. Both Frameworks incorporate JS elements as well, such as sliders and other menu types.

### Skills I Learned

I think I did learn a lot since the last blog. It was a lot more content heavy and there was a good but engaging challenge to learning how to use these Frameworks. So far I have used several different elements from both Frameworks, mostly Foundation but I am working on Bootstrap as well. I havent yet memorized any code snippets from the website so I just copy it over into the website to see if it works. For some reason some of the CSS doesnt register on the preview so it is a little annoying to know if you are doing things correctly or not

### EDP

The Engineering Design Process stage for this part of the Freedom Project is a little tricky. I feel like it is mostly back to stage 3, since we are trying to figure out how to use the Frameworks and how to make the website look good. But if people are quick they can start testing it and building it up in a very short amount of time, which would put them in Stage 6 or 7 since they are testing and improving their code. I think it is kind of jumping around different parts and completely bypasses the normal FP content.

### What Have I Reasearched? 
 **Systems:** Since the previous blog, I have made a decent amount of progress in reasearching about planes. I decided to focus more on the behind the scenes and what is going on in the cockpit. Systems such as [Garmin](Garmin.com) are huge parts of flying a plane and they have a lot of different things for different situations/planes. This includes radars, sensors, and even autopilot systems. Another big piece in flight hardware is [Fly-By-Wire](https://www.baesystems.com/en-us/definition/what-are-fly-by-wire-systems), which optimizies flight controls by using computers instead of hydraulics. This makes things a lot easier and a lot less complex for both pilots and the maitnence workers who help keep the plane working properly. <br>
    <br> **Training:** A training device that I found online were [Flight Simulators](https://www.deltamuseum.org/about-us/blog/from-the-hangars/2018/02/14/employee-spotlight-our-simulator-operators). Instead of going into a real plane to train (which is pretty expensive), pilots can go into a simulator which is often dedicated to a certain plane. This gets the pilot familiarized with the controls and how to fly the plane smoothly. Another simalair training device that I found are [Centrifuges](https://www.etcaircrewtraining.com/atfs-400-31-high-g-human-centrifuge-tactical-trainer.html). These are more for military use, and they are used to train fighter pilots for the high Gs that they might encounter while flying in intense situations. I think all of these are pretty cool and go towards my reasearch for the Freedom Project

### Engineering Design Process 
I think I am still in stage 2 of my Freedom Project because I am still reasearching things about aviation that people might not know. I havent started thinking of something to create either so I am still in Stage 2.

### Skills I Learned

* **Reading Websites:** I think from Blog 1 to this Blog, I really learned how to navigate and dig deep into websites. A lot of times when I google things, I only look at the boxes or the first few previews of things but I couldnt do that while reasearching. I had to go into the websites and click around to find what I wanted from there. Since I knew _where_ I wanted to go, it didnt take too long to figure out, especially if there was a built in search feature.

*  **Expanding My Search:** A lot of times I would also only use one search or just reword it a little to try and get different results, but that just didnt work this time. I learned how to get the results I wanted through using synonyms, and trying to come up with ways to google something specific that I hadnt thought of before.

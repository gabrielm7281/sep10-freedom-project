### What have I done so far?

In the 3 weeks that have passed by from the last blog, there have been major changes in the course. We went from just learning the tool to making a full website for the Freedom Project. Once again, I was heavily using [Foundation](https://get.foundation/) again, and I tried to make everything that wasn't regular HTML out of Foundation. I think I did good at that because a lot of the responsiveness and main features are built from Foundation elements from their Docs page. I am pretty sure there is zero Bootstrap except with some backend stuff which I still need to find and fix because it doesn't work very well with the rest of the page. The main feature of the Part A site was the [card](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/card.html) element. It displays a picture with a quick description beneath it and it was really useful for displaying some of the older technology that Aviation has. The main part of my second page displays my idea. For this I used the [Media Object](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/media-object.html) element, also from Foundation. It is kinda like a card, but smaller and sideways. It is more focused on the description instead of the picture, unlike the cards. I wanted to have some kind of diagram or model but I didn't have enough time to make it, so it is just a description of the idea that I had.

### Challenges that I Faced

This was actually one of the hardest projects that I have been assigned this year. For the majority of the semester we have been learning about a framework called [Bootstrap](get.bootstrap.com} but I decided to completely ignore that and try and mainly use Foundation. I think I succeded at that as I mentioned before, however, I learned responsiveness on Bootstrap and most of the Foundation elements aren't really compatible. I had to quickly learn and go through Foundations grid, which was actually pretty simple and easy to work out. It is called the `XY Grid` and it uses an activation class called `grid-x` to let the computer know whats happening. After that it is the screen size, followed by the columns. For example, if I wanted something to be 4 columns on a small screen and above, I would write : `small-12`. Of course there is more advanced stuff that I kinda used but I didnt fully understand how it worked and I only needed it for a few things.

I was also very limited on time for some of the project. I was away and didnt have much oppurtunity to work on the project so I had to finish it all in a rush once I was home again. I found it fun to do so I was able to work on it for a while outside of school and I would try and sneak in some more immprovements whenever I could. I got the MVP done in time and I think it was pretty good even though it was a little rushed. Since it was rushed I was a little stressed out and I can't think as well so I got a creative block and had no idea what to do at that point.

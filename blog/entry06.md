### What have I done so far?

In the 3 weeks that have passed by from the last blog, there have been major changes in the course. We went from just learning the tool to making a full website for the Freedom Project. Once again, I was heavily using [Foundation](https://get.foundation/) again, and I tried to make everything that wasn't regular HTML out of Foundation. I think I did good at that because a lot of the responsiveness and main features are built from Foundation elements from their Docs page. I am pretty sure there is zero Bootstrap except with some backend stuff which I still need to find and fix because it doesn't work very well with the rest of the page. The main feature of the Part A site was the [card](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/card.html) element. It displays a picture with a quick description beneath it and it was really useful for displaying some of the older technology that Aviation has. The main part of my second page displays my idea. For this I used the [Media Object](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/media-object.html) element, also from Foundation. It is kinda like a card, but smaller and sideways. It is more focused on the description instead of the picture, unlike the cards. I wanted to have some kind of diagram or model but I didn't have enough time to make it, so it is just a description of the idea that I had.

### Challenges that I faced

New grid
No Bootstrap
Revert to show wbesite before responsiveness
No time
Creative Blcok
